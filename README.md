  <h3>Milestone #1: November 20th, 2015 </h3>
  <strong>Goal:</strong> You should have solid planning done by the end of this milestone.
  <ul>
    <li>first task : who is doing it (if in team)</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Aman: Does fighter class, gets it to draw and animate(move and jump)
      </li>
      <li>
        Kunaal: Sets up background(PImage) and health bar(Class), gets started on drawing fighters
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <h3>Milestone #2: November 30th, 2015 </h3>
  <strong>Goal:</strong> You should have a small prototype by the end of this milestone.
  <ul>
    <li>first task : who is doing it (if in team)</li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Aman: Finishes fighter class with sprites with working collisions(Flipping and Pvector)
        </li>
        <li>
            Kunaal:finishes drawing and animation(Walking Right and Left, Attacking, Jumping, Crouching, Falling) of fighters. 
        </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Milestone #3: December 8th, 2015 (For C block)</br>
  Milestone #3: December 9th, 2015 (For G block) </h3>
  <strong>Goal:</strong> You should have iterated and improved on your prototype by the end of this milestone.
  <ul>
    <li>Aman: Arduino: Force Sensor Code (Testing and finishing design of force sensor controller</li>
    <li>Aman: Arduino: Makey Makey Controller (Testing and finishing design of Makey Makey Walk Pad</li>
